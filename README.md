# 👨‍💻 dos-layer4 👨‍💻
A simple Python script to perform DoS attacks on layer 4 level (IP:PORT). FOR LEARNING PURPOSES ONLY!

# 📝 Usage 📝
1. Open CMD and navigate to the folder where dos.py is located. Run `python dos.py`
2. Enter the IP address of the target -> press enter
3. If you want to attack a specific port, enter it now. If you don't enter anything, a random one will be taken. -> press enter
4. The buffer size is the size of a packet. If you don't specify anything, 1024 is taken as default. -> press enter
5. Each so-called "thread" sends packets to your specified destination permanently. 100 is a good number (and the default), your PC can't handle too many! -> press enter
6. Sit back and let the script run
